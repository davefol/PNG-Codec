# PNG-Codec
PNG Viewer, created live on twitch.tv/dixiedave

This is a from scratch PNG viewer written in C++.
The only library I use is SDL2 for a cross platform
way to display the final in memory image.

Every second of this repo was created while on
stream at twitch.tv/dixiedave (except for the inital 
commit of this README).

I also had no idea how to do this before I started so
the stream contains me working out each individual 
part of the PNG spec. My friends watching me on
Twitch provide helpful tips.

My plan is to create a nice
explainer video using my knowledge of PNG after
this software is completed.

Hope you join me on my journey :).
